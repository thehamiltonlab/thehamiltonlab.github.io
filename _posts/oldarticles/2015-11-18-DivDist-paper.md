Hannah Marx's paper investigating Darwin's Naturalization Conundrum using the flora of the San Juan Islands in the Pacific Northwest as a model was published today in Diversity and Distributions. This paper builds on the impressive floristic studies of our collaborators at the [University of Washington herbarium](http://www.burkemuseum.org/research-and-collections/botany-and-herbarium) with the addition of a phylogeny of the vascular flora, a compilation of data for five key functional traits, and an exhaustive set of community phylogenetic analyses.
