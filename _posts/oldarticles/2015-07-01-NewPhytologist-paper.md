The [Plant Radiations special issue of New Phytologist](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.2015.207.issue-2/issuetoc) was published this week, including our new paper investigating the [whole genome duplication radiation lag-time model](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526612000465). Our paper provides the first statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis, demonstrating a link between paleopolyploidy and increased rates of net diversification.
