This new funding is a collaborative project with [*Jack Sullivan*](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~jacks/) and [*Bryan Carstens*](http://carstenslab.org.ohio-state.edu/) that is focused on the development of a predictive framework for the discovery of cryptic biodiversity that can be applied to entire ecosystems and uses the disjunct rainforests of the Pacific Northwest as a model system for extending comparative phylogeography.
