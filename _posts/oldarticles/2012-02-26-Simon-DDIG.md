Congratulations to Simon Uribe-Convers on his successful NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) proposal!

*â€œInvestigating the accumulation of evidence for speciation: species delimitation in a rapid and recent radiation."*

This study seeks to understand how the evidence for speciation has accumulated over time in the mostly South American plant genus Bartsia L, inferring if there is an order or a sequence for the acquisition of species criteria, and if a specific criterion is more important than other at a certain point of time, e.g. is morphological differentiation more prominent than ecological divergence in recently divergent species?  Additionally, this study will provide a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for the South American species of Bartsia, which will provide a critical framework for future comparative, ecological and evolutionary studies.
