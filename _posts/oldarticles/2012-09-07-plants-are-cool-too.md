Check out our lab on the second episode of [**“Plants are Cool, Too!”**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2jD-ZIIgTfrk7DxzRQji_w) with host Dr. Chris Martine of Bucknell University. We had a lot of fun making this and hope you enjoy learning about the 15 million year old “Fossilized Forests” of northern Idaho.
