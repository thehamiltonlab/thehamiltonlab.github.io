Congratulations to Sarah Jacobs for her successful student grant proposals to the [American Society of Plant Taxonomists](http://www.aspt.net/news/2015/11/16/graduate-student-research-grants-1#.VorhXzZ7kVo)! Sarah's proposal, <i>"Examining differentiation of species criteria in diversification: a comparison of two species complexes in Castilleja (Orobanchaceae)"</i> was funded by the ASPT to support her ongoing fieldwork in western North America.
