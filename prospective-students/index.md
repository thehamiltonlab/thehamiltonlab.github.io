*I am working to build a diverse and interactive lab group interested in phylogenies and their applications in plant biology.*

### Graduate Research (MS, PhD)

I am seeking highly motivated students with a strong interest in plant systematics and evolution that are working towards a career or further degree involving collections based research, phylogenetics, phylogeography, taxonomy, and/or evolutionary biology to join my lab.

If you’re interested in using phylogenies to address evolutionary questions and want more information about joining the lab, contact me by phone (208) 885-7033 or email [*dtank [at] uidaho.edu*](mailto:dtank@uidaho.edu?subject=Prospective%20graduate%20student). To learn more about the community of evolutionary biologists at UIdaho, check out the [*Department of Biological Sciences*](http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/biology), the [*Institute for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies (IBEST)*](http://www.uidaho.edu/research/ibest) and the [*Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Program*](http://www.uidaho.edu/cogs/bcb). 

I also encourage you to read this blog post about [Applying to Biology PhD Programs](https://medium.com/@caseywdunn/applying-to-biology-phd-programs-58abece3284a).

#### the next step

Formal applications should include:

1. a cover letter
2. a general statement of research interests and experience
3. a CV, including names and contact information for at least three references

Interested applicants should email materials to [*dtank [at] uidaho.edu*](mailto:dtank@uidaho.edu?subject=Prospective%20graduate%20student).

Prospective students will be required to successfully enroll as a graduate student in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Idaho. For information about policies and entrance requirements pertaining to our department graduate programs go [*here*](http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/biology/academics/grad), and for University of Idaho admission go [*here*](http://www.uidaho.edu/graduateadmissions) 

### Undergraduate Research

There are numerous possibilities for small projects in the lab and I encourage inquiries from undergraduates interested in gaining research experience. If you’re interested in research opportunities in the lab and want more information about possibilities, contact me by phone (208) 885-7033 or email [*dtank [at] uidaho.edu*](mailto:dtank@uidaho.edu?subject=Undergraduate%20research).
