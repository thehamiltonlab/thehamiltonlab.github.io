**My lab, and the Arthropod Molecular Systematics Lab ([coPI Marek Borowiec](https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/entomology-plant-pathology-and-nematology/our-people/marek-borowiec)), are a family. We want to build a diverse and interactive lab group interested in phylogenies and their applications in understanding the evolution of spider and moth biodiversity.**

*We are a safe space for people of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and abilities.*

### Graduate Research (MS, PhD)

I am looking for passionate, independent students with an interest in evolutionary biology, phylogenetics, and entomology; in particular, those wanting wanting to do collections-based research, phylogenetics, taxonomy, and/or evolutionary biology.

Students will obtain research experience in a molecular laboratory, field work under variable conditions, knowledge in taxonomic identification, and experience with UNIX command line, R, and Python programming.

Student projects can be tied into ongoing research or developed according to mutual interests.

To learn more about the incredible community of evolutionary biologists at the University of Idaho, check out the [*Department of Entomology, Plant Pathology & Nematology*](https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/entomology-plant-pathology-and-nematology), the [*Department of Biological Sciences*](http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/biology), the [*Institute for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies (IBEST)*](http://www.uidaho.edu/research/ibest), and the [*Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Program*](http://www.uidaho.edu/cogs/bcb).


#### interested?

If you are interested in joining the lab, contact me by email [hamiltonlab [at] uidaho.edu](mailto:hamiltonlab@uidaho.edu?subject=Prospective%20graduate%20student) prior to applying.

Formal applications should include:

1. a cover letter
2. a brief statement describing the reasons for your interest in joining my lab, your research interests, and relevant past experiences and skills
3. a CV, including names and contact information for at least three references

Interested applicants should email materials to [hamiltonlab [at] uidaho.edu](mailto:hamiltonlab@uidaho.edu?subject=Prospective%20graduate%20student).

Prospective students will be required to successfully enroll as a graduate student in the Department of Entomology, Plant Pathology & Nematology at the University of Idaho. For information about policies and entrance requirements pertaining to our department graduate programs go [*here*](https://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/graduate/graduate-programs/entomology), and for University of Idaho admission go [*here*](http://www.uidaho.edu/graduateadmissions).


### Undergraduate Research

There are numerous possibilities for small projects in the lab and I encourage inquiries from undergraduates interested in gaining research experience. If you’re interested in research opportunities in the lab and want more information about possibilities, contact me by email [hamiltonlab [at] uidaho.edu](mailto:hamiltonlab@uidaho.edu?subject=Undergraduate%20research).
