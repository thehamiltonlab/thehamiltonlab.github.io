My goal as an advisor is to help graduate students become broadly trained in plant systematics and & phylogenetics while they develop as independent researchers by learning to identify interesting questions and the approaches necessary to address those questions.

**Anahi Espindola** - Anahi is from Argentina, and completed her PhD at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland where she studied comparative phylogeography of plant-pollinator interactions.

Anahi is now working on a collaborative project with [Jack Sullivan](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~jacks/) and [Bryan Carstens](http://carstenslab.org.ohio-state.edu/OSU/Carstens_Lab.html) investigating the comparative phylogeography of the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest, and developing tools to identify cryptic diversity in disjunct biomes.
