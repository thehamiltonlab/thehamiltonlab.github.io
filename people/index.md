My goal as an advisor is to help students become broadly trained in arthropod systematics and phylogenetics while they develop as independent researchers by learning to identify interesting questions and the approaches necessary to address those questions. As a Native person in academia, I want to be effective in my roles – as a mentor, as a holder of knowledge, and as an educator.

### Graduate Students
*PhD students*

**Karina Silvestre Bringas**

Karina is working on understanding the diversity and evolutionary history of the tarantula genus *Aphonopelma* across the Madrean Pine-Oak Woodlands Hotspot (aka - the sky islands of southern Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico). This is Karina holding a mature male *A. catalina*.

Karina comes to us from Marshal Hedin's [lab](https://marshalhedinlab.com) at San Diego State University, where she worked on jumping spider research as an undergraduate.

Erik is working on understanding the species diversity and evolutionary patterns and processes within the trapdoor spider genus *Antrodiaetus*. This is Erik finding his very first *Antrodiaetus*, in the Galiuro Mountains of Arizona!

Erik also comes to us from Marshal Hedin's [lab](https://marshalhedinlab.com) @ SDSU, where he got his Masters working on the spider genus *Hypochilus*. Thank you Marshal!

Arnau is working on understanding the diversity and evolutionary history of the mygalomorph genus *Euagrus* across the southwestern United States, the Madrean Pine-Oak Woodlands Hotspot (aka - the sky islands of southern Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico), and Mexico.

Arnau comes to us from Miguel Arnedo's [lab](https://marnedo.net) at the Departament de Biologia Evolutiva, Ecologia i Ciències Ambientals, Fac. Biologia, Universitat de Barcelona, where he worked on mygalomorph spider research for his Masters degree.

### Lab Manager

**Andrea Noble Stuen**

Andrea is the glue that holds together the Arthropod Molecular Systematics Lab. She joined the AMS lab in Fall 2020 and is loving the variety of working here, from molecular lab techniques to data management to macro photography and teaching and supporting others. She received her MS in Natural Resources from the University of Idaho, and a BA in Environmental Biology and Fine Arts from University of Colorado. She managed the daily work in a limnology (freshwater ecology) lab in Colorado, and brings experience from work in analytical chemistry, tree physiology, soils, fish ecology, and forestry. She is now thoroughly enjoying exploring arthropods and DNA.
