My goal as an advisor is to help students become broadly trained in arthropod systematics and & phylogenetics while they develop as independent researchers by learning to identify interesting questions and the approaches necessary to address those questions.

Karina is working on understanding the diversity and evolutionary history of the tarantula genus *Aphonopelma* across the Madrean Pine-Oak Woodlands Hotspot (aka - the sky islands of southern Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico). This is Karina holding a mature male *A. catalina*.

Karina comes to us from Marshal Hedin's [lab](https://marshalhedinlab.com) at San Diego State University, where she worked on jumping spider research as an undergraduate.

Erik is working on understanding the species diversity and evolutionary patterns and processes within the trapdoor spider genus *Antrodiaetus*. This is Erik finding his very first *Antrodiaetus*, in the Galiuro Mountains of Arizona!

Erik also comes to us from Marshal Hedin's lab @ SDSU, where he got his Masters working on the spider genus *Hypochilus*. Thank you Marshal!
