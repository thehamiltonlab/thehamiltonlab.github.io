## Current courses

### Structure and Function Across the Tree of Life (BIOL 213)

*4 credits, Spring; 3 lectures & 1 3-hr lab per week; co-taught with [Dr. Christine Parent](http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/biology/faculty/christine-parent)*

This course builds on introductory biology to examine some of the morphological and physiological similarities and differences that exist across the tree of life in a comparative framework, and to to learn how plants and animals have evolved morphological structures and physiological processes to adapt to the common challenges faced by all organisms.

### Advanced Field Botany (BIOL 460/560)

*3 credits, Summer; 2 week immersion*

This course is open to upper division undergraduates and early career graduate students that want to enhance their botanical knowledge and field skills with hands-on training in field botany as applied to evolutionary, ecological, and floristic studies. Students will learn the flora of Idaho during a two-week field experience in the Inland Northwest. 

Throughout the course we spend alternating days in the field and the classroom.  Field days strategically target a diversity of habitats/plant communities in under-collected areas throughout the Payette National Forest. Classroom days focus on identifying the collected specimens using a mix of short lectures, discussions, and hands-on learning. The research goal of the collecting expeditions is centered on conducting general botanical surveys to document the diversity and distribution of vascular plants in Idaho.

### Professional Development for Biologists (BIOL 552)

*3 credits, Fall; 2 meetings per week*

Communication skills are crucial for a successful science career. This course provides a structured environment with both faculty and peer-to-peer mentoring, to strengthen studentsâ€™ written and verbal communication skills and to foster a sense of community. The target audience is 1st and 2nd year graduate students, and the intent is to identify and practice skills that will help you have a productive, engaging, and timely graduate career, including communicating scientific topics to varied audiences, and submitting high quality grant proposals.

### Phylogenetics Reading Group (PuRGe; BIOL 536)

![PuRGe]({{ site.url }}/images/PuRGe.jpg)
{: .pull-right}

*1 credit, Fall & Spring; 1 discussion per week*

Phylogenetic methods have become increasingly necessary to address questions at all levels of biological diversity, ranging from the evolution of molecules, to organisms and communities. PuRGe meets once a week and different participants choose relevant papers and lead a discussion. All students, postdocs, and faculty are welcome - the goal being to gain a broader understanding of phylogenetic methods and their application to the investigation of evolutionary questions in biological systems.
